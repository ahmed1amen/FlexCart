# FlexCart
Package is under development.
This was a coding challenge for a job at "Edfa3ly",This code is Pure PHP,
because the task was not clear if I could use a framework or not. So I built it like this "Pure" ,
I tried to present something simple and committed to the required, but time is out before I finish , because I am very busy, and I only care about work.
there's no problem if I got a red flag. I am still very interested in your company. Please keep me in mind for any future opportunities as they arise.
